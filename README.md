# Linux X86 64-bit Intel Assembly

## Objective

To study a modern assembly language gaining better understanding of how computers work on a hardware level. It is also important to know how to integrate assembly language with hight level ones such as C and C++ for only assembly is capable of handling hadware interrupts and managing the memory mapping features of a cpu. Finally to understand that working with computers, in practice is more than abstract mathematics, we work with real hardware, with real hardware limitations, working with assembly helps one to graps said limitations.  

## How to run the code

Assembly is not a single language and is not portable either, so to run the code  you'll need a 64 bit linux computer with an intel chip or the means to emulate one. I'm storing the linked files here already, but if you wish to assemble the code yourself, yasm and ld are the suggested tools.
